                &nbsp;"Talents win games, but teamwork and intelligence win." Our team consists of marketers and computer programmers with various talents. Michael Jordan, one of the best basketball players of all time, said, "Playing on your side is not just on the basketball court or soccer field." Success in your job also means you're really good as a team player. We share our talents so that you can grow into a team player. As you know, companies expect employees to work together to handle their tasks efficiently and objectively. This is because teams bring the power of various perspectives, approaches, and skills to solve business challenges or problems. Teams increase momentum, motivate and responsibility, and help build an environment where people can learn from each other. You can use what you have learned in this way to your business. Being part of a team means that you can contribute to the entire organization by providing your expertise or strengths to collective and collaborative efforts. Don't you want to improve your team?

                    <div class="text" >
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;The most efficient way to use us is to hear your inner voice. Think about what team you were on when things went well and what team members you needed when things were hard. If you think about this part, we can be of greater help.

                    <div class="text ani">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Good team players understand what and why the team should do. In other words, they know how their skills and attributes contribute to collective effort. It's a quick way to break up the team to handle tasks only according to someone's instructions. Considering where you are, why you are, how you should support and improve other people's work, and what score your team members received out of 10 at the time, you can see more clearly how you can use us.

                    <div class="text ani">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend a healthy culture of advice to strengthen the team. As I ask, we should understand how to contribute to achieving common goals and team goals and criticize each other based on experience when we meet obstacles. But you have to be careful. Team members listen to you with opinions appropriate for achieving common goals when you are sincere, critical and helpful. Therefore, you should always be sincere and sincere. A good teammate doesn't blame his teammates, he just advises them to improve their team's skills.

                    <div class="text ani">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost impossible to avoid conflict in the workplace. In a way, it collides with people. Especially if the deadline is tight or stressful. It should be remembered that one of the biggest advantages of a good team is that various skills and various personalities come together. When disagreements arise, team participants should express their leadership in an atmosphere where they come to the table with solutions and ideas and exchange constructive criticism with others. Conflict management is a really important skill and core leadership ability that team members need regardless of their career aspirations.

                    <div class="text ani">
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;It's very important to know where your limits are, even boundaries. In that case, you can calculate your work performance and work. Participating in a team project is also a realistic response to promises. Excessive self-esteem can lead to stress, resentment, and some kind of disability that can interfere with group projects. The key is when and how to negotiate with the team leader or colleagues to finish the work well and meet the realistic deadline. Improving the team's skills is not always easy, and it may take time and experience. Therefore, based on what I have mentioned so far, your final reflection is needed now. Then we can be of greater help to your team and be part of a team that can beat society.
